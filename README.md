# lazygit config FOR MAC
- some opening commands are os specific -> check `os:` for that
- in order for this to work in the `~/.config/lazygit/config.yml` an export is required in the `~/.zshrc`, like so:
    `export XDG_CONFIG_HOME="$HOME/.config"` 
- check the [documentation](https://github.com/jesseduffield/lazygit/blob/master/docs/Config.md)
